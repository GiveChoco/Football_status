## Purpose of Data Collection :

We are collecting data to enhance the accessibility of team statistics, enabling fans and analysts to easily compare player performances and analyze trends. Going through sports websites manually looking for statistics is time-consuming. Our project works on simplifying this process by centralizing and clarifying the data, making it readily accessible and easier to interpret and understand.The collected data will primarily be used for in-depth analysis and research of player performances, offering insights for sports fans as well as analysts which will then help in conducting data driven decisions about the teamâ€™s competitive standing.


## Availability of data scraping :

We are committed to scraping data only from sources that do not explicitly prohibit it in their terms of use. We reviewed the robots.txt file https://fbref.com/robots.txt to ensure compliance with any restrictions outlined by the website.
