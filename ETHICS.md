## Purpose of data collection 

We are collecting (scraping data) to easily display player status and compare them with the opponent team. This way, we donâ€™t have to individually go through the website or be confused on what the status means 

## Availability of data scraping 

Generously, [https://fbref.com](https://fbref.com) allowed web scraping. Although I could not find robots.txt 

## Collection practices  

There is no extensive loop / unnecessary repetition in collecting or scraping data. 

## Data privacy 

There is no privately held data, therefore no security measures are needed 

## Data usage

All data scraped will be used exclusively for educational and research purposes
